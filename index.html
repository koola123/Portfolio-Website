              <p>
                Who am I and why I want to make a career change from Sales 
                into Software Development. In short, here is my answer: <br><br>

                Having worked in Sales for more than 10 years in different business 
                sectors, in one of my former positions as a consultant at an international 
                operating US-staffing firm, I, of course, 
                came across to many specialists working in that field.
                Among other aspects, I got extremely excited and inspired by those candidates 
                in terms of their knowledge, their way to work, their projects and duties etc., 
                and I said to myself "It's phantastic what they are doing. It's much more than a
                job, it's a kind of self-realization."<br><br>

                Coming back to me, my first touch with IT-Programming was already in the early 
                2000's when I was coding static websites for family and some friends. However, 
                it was just a hobby for several years, but coding in general became more and more 
                interesting to me. As mentioned at the beginning, a few years ago, there was a turning point in my 
                career development when meeting candidates from the IT-industry. I began looking for 
                appropriate opportunities how to become quickly a professional web developer. Going back 
                to the university or a college to take up a related study was not an option as it simply 
                takes too long. The most feasible solution turned out to be a an Online coding bootcamp as 
                I had to work full-time for financial reasons. After a thorough research I came across to 
                "CareerFoundry", a Berlin-based company for further education wich offers a range of different Software trainings. I realized 
                that CareerFoundry has a very good reputation and is offering solid IT-programs. As it was matching 
                my expectation and desires I decided to attend the program "Full-Stack Web Development".<br><br>

                During my bootcamp studies I learned a lot about modern web technologies like React, 
                React Native, Angular, and other state-of-the-art JavaScript libraries and frameworks, but also about
                serverless functions in the cloud, e.g. Amazon Web Services and databases like MongDB. Needless to mention, it was a tough and challenging time in every aspect to complete the 
                program, but it was also a very exciting experience and I learned a lot. Recently, i.e. on May, 30th 2023, I successfully completed the program with 6 bootcamp projects and
                1 project I took from a boiler-plate-code YouTube tutorial - The Ecommerce shopping cart, wich is the final
                name of the application I build. For a first look, please have a look at GitHub where all of my self-coded
                projects are deployed to.<br><br/>
                
                Now, I'm very excited about finding an interesting entry-level-position in the business world to really get 
                my hands dirty, to deepen my IT-knowledge and, of course, to build more sophisticated real-world-projects in an
                exciting and supporting team environment. In principle, I am open to job offers worldwide with preference
                to Europe, USA, Canada, East-Asia (preferably Japan), and Australia. My earliest possible starting date would
                be the 1st of August 2023.
